- PHP is responsible for insertion with the database, automatically performing database and table creation queries, as well as deleting when a new insert is made; The search and manipulation of data for the elaboration of a new Json string is the responsibility of PHP to return the treated string with all relationships and performing a 'refactoring' through JQuery's Ajax.
